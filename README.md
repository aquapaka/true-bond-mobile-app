- Use Conventional Commits:

  ```none
  feat: Add new feature for period tracking
  fix: Resolve issue with login authentication
  chore: Update dependencies and configurations
  refactor: Improve code structure for API calls
  ```

- Write clear and concise commit messages.
  Group related changes into a single commit.
- Use present tense and imperative mood in commit messages.
- Avoid vague commit messages like "fix bug" or "update code."
- Reference issues when applicable (e.g., `fix: Resolve login issue (#42)`).
